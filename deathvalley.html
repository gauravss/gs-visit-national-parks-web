                    <p>
                        Death Valley National Park is a national park in the U.S. states of California and Nevada located east of the Sierra Nevada, occupying an interface zone between the arid Great Basin and Mojave deserts in the United States. The park protects the northwest corner of the Mojave Desert and contains a diverse desert environment of salt-flats, sand dunes, badlands, valleys, canyons, and mountains. It is the largest national park in the lower 48 states and has been declared an International Biosphere Reserve. Approximately 95% of the park is a designated wilderness area. It is the hottest and driest of the national parks in the United States. The second-lowest point in the Western Hemisphere is in Badwater Basin, which is 282 feet (86 m) below sea level. The park is home to many species of plants and animals that have adapted to this harsh desert environment.<br/>

                <section id="tab3" class="content">
                    <p>By Private Plane :There is a small public airport at Furnace Creek. Fuel is NOT available at the airport. There is also a rough paved strip at Stovepipe Wells. No fuel is available. We recommend airport information manuals for further details.</p>
                    <p>The main road transecting Death Valley National Park from east to west is California Highway 190.</p>
                    <p>On the east in Nevada, U.S. Route 95 parallels the park from north to south with connecting highways at Scotty's Junction (State Route 267), Beatty (State Route 374), and Lathrop Wells (State Route 373).</p>
                    <p>Coming from the west, State Route 14 and U.S. Route 395 lead to Ridgecrest, CA where State Route 178 heads east into the park. Further north on Hwy 395 at Olancha, CA you can join Hwy 190 to the park, or north of that at Lone Pine, CA, Hwy 136 will also join Hwy 190 heading east into the park.</p>
                    <p>From the South, Interstate 15 passes through Baker, California on its way from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. State Route 127 travels north from Baker to Shoshone and Death Valley Junction with connections to the park on State Route 178 from Shoshone and connection with California Highway 190 at Death Valley Junction.</p>

                        Death Valley National Park is open year round. Modern well-maintained and air-conditioned vehicles usually have little trouble with desert travel, but summer trips do require extra planning and extra care. Temperatures begin to moderate, dropping below the 100 degree mark, in mid October and the peak visitor season runs through the cool winter and spring months into the middle of April when temperatures again climb above 100.
